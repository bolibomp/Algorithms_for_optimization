    "**Exercise 19.1**  A Boolean satisfiability problem, often abbreviated SAT, requires determining whether a Boolean design exists that causes a Boolean-valued objective function to output true. SAT problems were the first to be proven to belong to the difficult class of NP-complete problems.21 This means that SAT is at least as difficult as all other problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time. Consider the Boolean objective function:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** We are interested in totally unimodular matrices because they have the property that the solution to the linear program is always integer. This means that we can solve the linear integer program as a linear program and then round the solution to the nearest integer. This is much faster than solving the linear integer program directly.\n",
    "Totally unimodular matrices have the property that every square submatrix has determinant -1, 0, or 1. This means that the determinant of the matrix is -1, 0, or 1. Since the determinant is the sum of the products of the elements of the matrix, and the elements are integers, the determinant must be an integer. Therefore, the determinant can only be -1, 0, or 1."
